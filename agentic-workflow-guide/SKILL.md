# Agentic Workflow Guide

A comprehensive guide for designing, reviewing, and improving agent workflows based on proven design principles.

## When to Use

Use this skill when creating, reviewing, or updating agents and workflows:

### Create

- **New agent design** - Define responsibilities, tools, and prompts for `.agent.md` files
- **Workflow architecture** - Choose from 5 patterns (Prompt Chaining, Routing, Parallelization, Orchestrator-Workers, Evaluator-Optimizer)
- **Scaffolding** - Generate `.github/agents/*.agent.md` structure with `scaffold_workflow.py`

### Review

- **Orchestrator not delegating** - Agent says "I'll use sub-agents" but does work directly
- **Design principle check** - Validate against SSOT, SRP, Fail Fast, Feedback Loop
- **Context overflow diagnosis** - Long-running agents hitting limits

### Update

- **Adding Handoffs** - Implement Plan → Implement → Review phase transitions
- **Improving delegation** - Fix vague instructions with MUST/MANDATORY language
- **Tool configuration** - Configure `tools:` property and `#tool:` references

## Core Principles

→ See **[references/design-principles.md](references/design-principles.md)** for details

| Tier                  | Principles                                                                  | Focus                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Tier 1: Essential** | SSOT, SRP, Simplicity First, Fail Fast, Iterative Refinement, Feedback Loop | Must-have for any workflow |
| **Tier 2: Quality**   | Transparency, Gate/Checkpoint, DRY, ISP, Idempotency, Observability         | Recommended for production |
| **Tier 3: Scale**     | Human-in-the-Loop, KISS, Loose Coupling, Graceful Degradation               | Advanced patterns          |

**Anthropic's Key Insight:**

> "Start with simple prompts, optimize them with comprehensive evaluation, and add multi-step agentic systems only when simpler solutions fall short."

## Workflow Patterns

→ See **[references/workflow-patterns.md](references/workflow-patterns.md)** for details

### Pattern Selection Guide

```
What's the nature of the task?
├─ Sequential processing needed ──→ Prompt Chaining
├─ Multiple independent tasks ────→ Parallelization
├─ Dynamic task decomposition ────→ Orchestrator-Workers
├─ Until quality criteria met ────→ Evaluator-Optimizer
└─ Processing varies by input ────→ Routing
```

### Workflow vs Agent (Stop Conditions)

- **Workflow**: Fixed path with explicit stages and checkpoints. Prefer when steps are known.
- **Agent**: Dynamic decisions and tool use. Prefer when inputs or paths vary.

**Stop Conditions (MANDATORY):**

- Define success criteria (output format, quality bar, tests).
- Define failure criteria (max retries, missing data, validation fail).
- Ensure each loop has an exit condition.

### Pattern Overview

| Pattern                  | Use Case                           | Iterative Level |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Prompt Chaining**      | Sequential with validation         | ⭐⭐⭐          |
| **Routing**              | Classify → route to specialists    | ⭐⭐            |
| **Parallelization**      | Execute independent tasks together | ⭐⭐            |
| **Orchestrator-Workers** | Dynamic decomposition → workers    | ⭐⭐⭐          |
| **Evaluator-Optimizer**  | Generate → evaluate → improve loop | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐      |

## Design Workflow

### Step 1: Requirements Gathering

```markdown
## Workflow Design Interview

1. **Goal**: What do you want to achieve?
2. **Task Decomposition**: What subtasks can this be broken into?
3. **Dependencies**: Are there ordering dependencies between tasks?
4. **Parallelism**: Which tasks can run independently?
5. **Quality Criteria**: What defines success/failure?
6. **Error Handling**: How should failures be handled?
```

### Step 2: Pattern Selection

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Ask user to confirm pattern before proceeding.**

Based on requirements, recommend a pattern and get user approval:

```markdown
## Pattern Recommendation

Based on your requirements, I recommend:

**🎯 Recommended: {Pattern Name}**

- Reason: {why this pattern fits}

**Other Options:**
| Pattern | Fit | Notes |
| -------------------- | --- | ------------------------ |
| Prompt Chaining | ⭐⭐ | Good if sequential |
| Routing | ⭐ | If input types vary |
| Parallelization | ⭐⭐ | If tasks are independent |
| Orchestrator-Workers | ⭐⭐⭐| Dynamic task count |
| Evaluator-Optimizer | ⭐ | If quality loop needed |

**Proceed with {Pattern Name}? (Yes / Other pattern / More info)**
```

**Pattern Selection Criteria:**

| Condition                         | Recommended Pattern  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Tasks have clear ordering         | Prompt Chaining      |
| Tasks are independent             | Parallelization      |
| Number of tasks is dynamic        | Orchestrator-Workers |
| Repeat until quality criteria met | Evaluator-Optimizer  |
| Processing varies by input type   | Routing              |

→ See **[references/workflow-patterns.md](references/workflow-patterns.md)** for detailed pattern descriptions

### Step 3: Create Design Diagram

Visualize with Mermaid:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Task Classification}
    B -->|Type A| C[Agent 1]
    B -->|Type B| D[Agent 2]
    C --> E[Reviewer]
    D --> E
    E -->|OK| F[End]
    E -->|NG| G[Feedback]
    G --> C
    G --> D
```

### Step 4: Principle Check

Validate design against principles (use review checklist)

### Step 5: Implement & Iterate

Build small → verify → get feedback → improve

## Prompt Composition Template

Use a minimal, high-signal prompt structure. Keep only what the task needs.

```markdown
# Objective

- Do: [what to do]
- Don't: [what to avoid]

# Input

- Data: [files, text, or references]
- Assumptions: [constraints or environment]

# Output Format

- Format: [bullet list / JSON / table]
- Length: [max items / max tokens]

# Examples (1–3 representative)

- Example 1: [input → output]
  - Note: Explain why this is a good example

# Validation Criteria

- Test: [test name or procedure]
- Expected: [exact pass condition]
- Fail: [what to do on failure]

# Escape Hatch

- If missing or uncertain, return: "Not found" (or specified fallback)

# Additional Context

- Only the minimum needed context
```

## Review Checklist

→ See **[references/review-checklist.md](references/review-checklist.md)** for complete checklist (includes anti-patterns)

### Quick Check (5 items)

```markdown
- [ ] Is each agent focused on a single responsibility? (SRP)
- [ ] Can errors be detected and stopped immediately? (Fail Fast)
- [ ] Is it divided into small steps? (Iterative)
- [ ] Can results be verified at each step? (Feedback Loop)
- [ ] Are related files (references, scripts) simple and minimal? (DRY)
```

## Validation & Evals

Define how quality is verified and how regressions are detected.

**Minimum Set:**

- Tests or evaluation steps are explicit.
- Expected results are measurable.
- Regression checks are repeatable after model updates.

**Example (template):**

```markdown
- Test: [name]
  - Step: [command or procedure]
  - Expected: [clear pass condition]
  - On Failure: [retry / diagnose / report diff]
```

## Context Engineering

→ See **[references/context-engineering.md](references/context-engineering.md)** for details

For long-running agents, manage context as a finite resource:

| Technique                   | When to Use                            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Compaction**              | Context window 70%+ full               |
| **Structured Note-taking**  | Multi-hour tasks with milestones       |
| **Sub-agent Architectures** | Complex research, parallel exploration |
| **Just-in-Time Retrieval**  | Large codebases, dynamic data          |

**Key Insight:**

> "Context must be treated as a finite resource with diminishing marginal returns." — Anthropic

## runSubagent Implementation

→ See **[references/runSubagent-guide.md](references/runSubagent-guide.md)** for complete guide

### Common Problem: Orchestrator Doesn't Spawn Sub-agents

**Symptoms:** Agent says "I'll delegate to sub-agents" but does work directly.

**Root Cause:** Instructions are too vague or permissive.

**Solution:** Use imperative, mandatory language:

```yaml
---
name: Review Orchestrator
# Use Primary Aliases
tools: ["agent", "read"]
---

## MANDATORY: Sub-agent Delegation

You MUST use #tool:agent for each file review.
Do NOT read file contents directly in main context.

For EACH file:
1. Call agent with prompt:
   "Read {filepath}. Return: {issues: [], suggestions: []}"
2. Wait for summary response
3. Aggregate into final report
```

### Sub-agent Prompt Template

Each runSubagent call needs a **complete, self-contained prompt**:

```markdown
# Task

[Clear, specific objective]

# Input

[What data/files to process]

# Output Format

[Exact structure expected - JSON/Markdown/etc.]

# Constraints

[Scope limits, max length, focus areas]
```

### Quick Checklist

```markdown
- [ ] Agent definition includes `tools: ["agent"]` (Primary Alias)
- [ ] Instructions use MUST/MANDATORY (not "can" or "may")
- [ ] Sub-agent prompt template is defined with output format
- [ ] Orchestrator explicitly told NOT to do sub-agent work itself
```

## Handoffs (Agent Transitions)

→ See **[references/agent-template.md](references/agent-template.md#handoffs-agent-transitions)** for details

Enable guided sequential workflows: Plan → Implement → Review.

```yaml
handoffs:
  - label: Start Implementation
    agent: implementation
    prompt: Implement the plan outlined above.
```

## Available Tools

→ See **[references/agent-template.md](references/agent-template.md#available-tools)** for full reference

Use **Primary Alias** in `tools:` property:

| Primary Alias | Description             |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| `execute`     | Shell command execution |
| `read`        | Read file contents      |
| `edit`        | Edit/create files       |
| `search`      | Search files/text       |
| `agent`       | Spawn sub-agent         |
| `web`         | Fetch web content       |

## Scaffold Workflow

Automatically generate workflow directory structures.
